# Task 4: Logistic Regression Classification

This project demonstrates how to build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## ✅ Objective
To learn binary classification using logistic regression and evaluate model performance using key metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## 📁 Dataset
We use the built-in **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** from `scikit-learn`.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Load and explore dataset.
2. Preprocess and standardize features.
3. Train/test split.
4. Fit a Logistic Regression model.
5. Evaluate using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision & Recall
   - ROC-AUC
   - Threshold tuning
6. Visualize the Sigmoid Function.

## 📊 Output
- Confusion Matrix heatmap
- ROC Curve
- Sigmoid Curve
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score metrics

## 📄 Files Included
- `Logistic_Regression_Task.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all steps.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
