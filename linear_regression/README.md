# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to use **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, and more. It's part of Task 3 in the AI & ML Internship.

---

## 📌 What This Project Does

- Loads and cleans a housing dataset
- Applies **Multiple Linear Regression**
- Evaluates the model using MAE, MSE, and R² Score
- Visualizes the Actual vs Predicted house prices
- Shows how each feature affects the price

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

---

## 📁 Dataset

We used the [Housing Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction) from Kaggle.

Make sure to place `Housing.csv` in the same folder as the notebook.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook `linear_regression_task3.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all the cells
