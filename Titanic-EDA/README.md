# Titanic EDA Task ðŸš¢

## Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights using visualizations and statistics.

## Objectives
- Understand dataset structure and summary
- Identify missing values and outliers
- Explore patterns using boxplots, histograms, and heatmaps
- Interpret relationships between features and survival

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
- [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- File used: `titanic.csv`

## Visualizations
- Histogram & boxplot for age and fare
- Countplot for survival by gender and class
- Heatmap for correlation analysis
- Pairplot for feature relationships

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Place `titanic.csv` in the root folder
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `EDA_Titanic.ipynb`

## Insights
- Female passengers survived more.
- 1st class had highest survival rate.
- Age & fare impact survival, but not linearly.
