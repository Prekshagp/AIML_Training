# Support Vector Machines - Breast Cancer Classification

This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn.

## ðŸ“Œ Task Objectives
- Load and prepare the dataset
- Train SVM with Linear and RBF kernels
- Visualize decision boundaries using PCA
- Evaluate the model using accuracy and cross-validation

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
We use the  dataset from kaggle that is ' https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset', which includes features like mean radius, texture, and smoothness of cell nuclei.

## ðŸ§  Models Used
- SVM with Linear Kernel
- SVM with RBF Kernel

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Cross-validation Score

## ðŸ“Ž Tools and Libraries
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (SVM, PCA, Metrics)

## ðŸ§ª How to Run
1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook `svm_breast_cancer.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
